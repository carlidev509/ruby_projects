Caesar Cipher or Shift Cipher, is a very special case of the subtitution cipher, it is said to have been used by Julius Caesar to communicate with his army.

I was given an exercise in which I was to implement a caesar cipher that takes in a string and a shift factor, and then output the modified string.

For example, with a right shift of 3, A would be replaced by D, B would be replaced by E.
